# DS-2: Top Drivers of Tip % (Manager Summary)

## Top 3 Drivers (ranked by tip % spread)

- **Party size** (tip % spread: 7.58%)
- **Day of week** (tip % spread: 1.68%)
- **Sex (use carefully)** (tip % spread: 0.88%)

## Recommended Actions
### Staffing
- Add more coverage during periods with higher total bills and unstable tip %.
- Ensure experienced staff are scheduled during the most sensitive shifts.

### Service Coaching
- Train staff to handle table types linked with lower tip % (example: larger parties).
- Create a quick service checklist for high-risk tables (greeting time, drink refill cadence, bill timing).

### Monitoring
- Track outliers weekly: large bills with low tip % to identify service failures or policy issues.
- Use tip % (not tip amount) to compare fairness across shifts.
